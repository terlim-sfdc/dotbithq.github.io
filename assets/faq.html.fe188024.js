We always need a suffix to recognize some kinds of things, such as file type, email address, domain name, etc. Even if the .bit account has a suffix, .bit, making it looks like a TLD, it is not.</p><h3 id="is-bit-decentralized" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-bit-decentralized" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Is .bit decentralized?</h3><p>Yes! .bit is a Decentralized Account System that runs on Nervos CKB, a PoW permissionless chain with a highly open architecture.</p><p>The source code for all core components of .bit is open-sourced and can be found on Github.</p><h2 id="registration-related" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#registration-related" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Registration Related</h2><h3 id="what-public-chain-addresses-can-i-use-to-register-for-a-bit-account" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-public-chain-addresses-can-i-use-to-register-for-a-bit-account" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What public chain addresses can I use to register for a .bit account?</h3><p>Currently, .bit accounts can be registered with ETH / TRX / BSC / Polygon addresses.

Here are some reasons:</p><ol><li>.bit, as an infrastructure, needs continuous improvement by the developers. There are .bit accounts that are relatively more desired. If they are purchased out, the .bit system is no longer able to generate revenue, the existing development team would have no incentive to continuously improve the system, and new developers would not be attracted to maintain the system. It may sound like a good idea to buy once and use forever, but the user is buying an account that would not be maintained in the future.</li><li>The loss of a private key will cause a permanent lock of a .bit account.

What is the principle of anti-squatting?</h3><p>On the blockchain, all the operations from a user are public and transparent. Therefore, when a user wants to register a certain .bit account and the corresponding transaction is still in the memory pool and not packed into the block, other people can see what account this user wants to register. Others can grab the account by immediately issuing a transaction with a higher gas fee to get miners to package the transaction first, and then sell the account at a higher price to people who want it. Preventing robocalls is to prevent such behaviors as much as possible.</p><p>To prevent squatting behaviors, the .bit contract requires a two-step process, corresponding to two transactions, for registering a new account.</p><ol><li><strong>Apply for registration in private</strong>: Hash the account to be registered with the registrant&#39;s public key, send the first transaction, and place this hash on the blockchain</li><li><strong>Reveal the account name on the chain</strong>: Initiate a registration request, exposing the account name to be registered and carrying the hash from the previous step, while the contract requires the hash to reach a mature state, i.e. the last transaction has been packed into the block and reached a certain number of confirmations.</li></ol><p>The two transactions need to be spaced, and the second transaction needs to include the Cell created by the first transaction. In addition, the user only discloses the plaintext of the account they want to register in the second step. By the time a malicious Keeper or miner sees the plaintext, it&#39;s too late. He has to start with the first transaction, and by the time he&#39;s ready, other Keepers have already registered the account for the user.</p><h3 id="why-does-the-interface-show-that-i-have-finished-the-anti-squatting-step-but-the-bit-account-i-want-to-register-is-taken-by-someone-else" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-the-interface-show-that-i-have-finished-the-anti-squatting-step-but-the-bit-account-i-want-to-register-is-taken-by-someone-else" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does the interface show that I have finished the anti-squatting step but the .bit account I want to register is taken by someone else?</h3><p>It could happen when you and someone else is trying to register the same .bit account at the same time. Anti-squatting can only prevent malicious squatting when someone gets the account you want to register by watching the blockchain.

Modifying records is a high frequency operation, while modifying ownership is a low frequency operation. The high frequency operation will then use the private key frequently, increasing the risk of losing the private key. This separation design allows users to maintain the ownership of the account even if the manager&#39;s private key is lost. The owner and manager can be the same address or different addresses.
